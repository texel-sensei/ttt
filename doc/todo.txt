========================================
Tasks between 12.05.2000 and 14.05.2000
Task A: 10h
Task B: 9h
Task C: 15h
========================================

Time parser:

> ttt summarize today
> ttt summarize last week
> ttt summarize this week
> ttt summarize 2020-03 to 2023-07-03
> ttt summarize last month
> ttt summarize yesterday to today

The cutoff for "today" should be configurable, so e.g. 00:01 can still count as the previous day.
